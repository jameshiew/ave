# ave - Another Voxel Engine

An open ended project in voxel-based procedural generation.

First class priorities are roughly:
* performance
* endlessly scalable worlds - no arbitrary limitations on x/y/z dimensions, or as close as is possible to achieve
* an intuitive and smooth UX with regards to being able to experiment with different forms of world generation
